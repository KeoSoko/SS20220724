## SLIDE 4: THE FOUNDER'S JOURNEY

### A Story of Determination & Problem-Solving

**Keorapetse Soko**

**13 years as Registered Tax Practitioner & Bookkeeper**  
**Self-Taught Developer**  
**Working Wife & Mother to a 4-Year-Old**

**The Defining Moment:**  
*"I was sitting across from yet another small business owner during tax season, watching them frantically search through shoeboxes of faded receipts. After 13 years of seeing this same story, I looked at the apps on the market—all built by developers who'd never filed a South African tax return.*

*None of them understood the real problem.*

*So I made a decision that most people thought was crazy: while working full-time and raising a 4-year-old, I taught myself to code and built Simple Slips myself. Not because I wanted to be a developer, but because I refused to watch one more client lose money to lost receipts."*

**Why This Matters:**  
This isn't a tech founder who researched a market opportunity. This is a domain expert with 13 years of lived experience who learned an entirely new skill set to solve a problem she witnessed every single day.

## SLIDE 8: USER IMPACT STORIES

### Real Problems, Real Solutions

**The Freelance Graphic Designer:**
*"I used to dread tax season. Receipts everywhere, half of them faded. I'd spend entire weekends trying to piece together my expenses. Last year I probably missed R8,000 in deductions because I couldn't find receipts. This changes everything."*

*"I was paying R350/month for separate tools: QuickBooks for invoicing, Expensify for receipts, and still writing payment reminder emails manually. Simple Slips does it ALL for R49/month. The AI writes my invoice emails with my banking details already filled in—I just review and send. My clients are paying faster because the reminders go out automatically. I'm saving money AND getting paid quicker. Game changer."*

## APPENDIX: SPEAKER NOTES & PRESENTATION TIPS

### How to Present This Deck for Maximum Impact

**Overall Approach:**
- Lead with emotion and purpose, not features
- Return to user impact throughout the presentation
- Use "I" not "we" (you're the solo founder—own your journey!)
- Be authentic—your story is your superpower
- Connect every technical point back to human impact

**Slide-by-Slide Tips:**

**Slide 2 (Problem):**
- Start with a specific story: "Picture this—it's April, tax deadline approaching. A small restaurant owner sits across from me with three shoeboxes of receipts. Some are faded, some are crumpled, some are gone entirely. She knows she's about to lose thousands in deductions, and there's nothing I can do to help her."
- Make it visceral and relatable
- Emphasize the human cost, not just the money

**Slide 4 (Founder Journey):**
- **This is your moment**—take your time here
- Share the emotion of that "defining moment"
- Emphasize the boldness: "Most people would have outsourced this or waited for someone else. I taught myself to code while working full-time and raising a 4-year-old."
- Connect your background to your unique advantage: "I didn't have to research what tax practitioners need—I AM a tax practitioner."

**Slide 6 (AI Advantage):**
- Keep technical language simple but impressive
- Focus on the outcome: "It learns from you and gets smarter every time you use it"
- Use the confidence scoring as a tangible example: "The app tells you which receipts look good and which need a second look—something that comes from 13 years of knowing what raises red flags."

**Slide 7 (Mission & Impact):**
- Emphasize the democratization angle
- Connect to broader SA economic themes
- "Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, yet most can't afford the tools large companies use. That's not fair. Simple Slips changes that."

**Slide 8 (User Impact Stories):**
- Bring these to life—use names if you have real testimonials
- Vary the types of users to show breadth
- Focus on the emotional transformation: stress → confidence

**Slide 10 (Bold Ambitions):**
- Lead with impact metrics, not revenue
- "I want to help 10,000 South Africans save R10 million collectively—that's real money staying in small businesses where it belongs"
- Be confident but grounded: "These numbers are ambitious, but here's why they're achievable..."
- Connect partnerships back to impact: "Partnering with Xero and Sage means seamless workflows for users"

**Slide 12 (Community & Social Impact):**
- This is where you expand beyond the product
- Connect to award themes (innovation, impact, community, future)
- "This isn't just about building an app—it's about empowering an entire generation of SA entrepreneurs"

**Slide 14 (Why This Matters):**
- Bring it back to emotion and purpose
- "Yes, this is a tech product. But more importantly, it's about giving people confidence and control over their financial future."
- Connect your personal journey to broader themes
- "If a self-taught developer and working mom can do this, imagine what's possible for SA tech"

**Closing Tips:**
- End on vision and inspiration
- Reiterate your unique position: expertise + determination + execution
- Leave them with the impact vision: "R10 million saved. 80,000 hours reclaimed. Thousands of families with less stress."
- Final line with conviction: "Receipts keep slipping away? We keep 'em on lock."

**General Presentation Advice:**
- Practice the founder story until it flows naturally
- Use pauses for emphasis on big numbers
- Make eye contact when sharing personal moments
- Show passion without apologizing for ambition
- If asked about competition, return to your unique advantage: "Nobody else has 13 years as a tax practitioner AND taught themselves to code"
- If asked about challenges, be honest but frame as learning: "Learning to code while working full-time was brutal, but it gave me something no other founder in this space has"
- Connect every answer back to impact and users

**Remember:**
- Award judges want to see passion, impact, and resilience
- They want to back founders solving real problems with unique insights
- Your story is powerful because it's authentic
- You're not asking for permission—you're inviting them to be part of something meaningful

**You've got this. Go win that award.** 🏆
