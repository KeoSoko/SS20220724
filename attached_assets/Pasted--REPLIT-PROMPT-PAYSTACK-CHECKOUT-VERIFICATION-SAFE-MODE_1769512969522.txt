🔧 REPLIT PROMPT — PAYSTACK CHECKOUT VERIFICATION (SAFE MODE)

Goal:
Confirm that the app has fully switched back from paymentRequest() to checkout() and that all payment channels (Apple Pay, QR, EFT, card) are available and not accidentally restricted.

Please provide the following, without refactoring anything yet:

1️⃣ Frontend Paystack Entry Point

Show all files where Paystack is initialized or called on the frontend, including:

Subscription / upgrade page

Any Apple Pay–specific components

Any conditional device checks (Safari / iOS detection)

Specifically, I need:

The exact function that is called when the user clicks “Pay / Subscribe”

The full Paystack call (checkout() or paymentRequest()), including all options passed

2️⃣ Confirm No paymentRequest() Is Still Active

Search the entire frontend codebase and report:

Any remaining references to:

paymentRequest(

paystack-apple-pay

loadPaystackCheckoutButton

If found, show the file + line numbers

3️⃣ Paystack Script Version

Show where Paystack is loaded:

<script src="https://js.paystack.co/v2/inline.js"> or similar

Confirm InlineJS v2 is being used

File and location where the script is injected (index.html / layout / component)

4️⃣ Checkout Configuration

Show the full checkout() configuration object, including:

key

email

amount

currency

channels (IMPORTANT — confirm whether this is set or omitted)

onSuccess, onCancel, onClose

⚠️ I specifically want to confirm:

Are channels explicitly restricted?

Or is Paystack allowed to auto-detect channels?

5️⃣ Backend Verification (No Logic Changes)

Confirm:

/api/billing/paystack/subscription still handles success the same way

No Apple Pay–specific branching exists on the backend

No channel-based assumptions are made server-side

Just show the route handler — no edits.

6️⃣ Environment & Domain Sanity Check

Provide:

Public Paystack key in use (TEST vs LIVE — redact value)

Whether Apple Pay domain verification is still enabled in dashboard

Whether multiple domains are involved (e.g. .app vs .co.za)

7️⃣ Final Question (Answer Explicitly)

Answer YES or NO to each:

Is checkout() the only Paystack entry point now?

Can non-Apple users see QR / EFT?

Can Apple users still see Apple Pay?

Important instructions:

❌ Do NOT refactor yet

❌ Do NOT optimize

❌ Do NOT remove Apple Pay config from dashboard

✅ Only report findings

✅ Highlight anything suspicious or ambiguous
