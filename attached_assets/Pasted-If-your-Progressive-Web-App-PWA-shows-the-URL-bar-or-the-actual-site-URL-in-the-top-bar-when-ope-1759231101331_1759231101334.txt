If your Progressive Web App (PWA) shows the URL bar (or the actual site URL in the top bar) when opened from the Play Store (after being built with PWA Builder and installed via TWA), even though you've fixed the assetlinks.json file, here's a clear checklist to ensure everything is working as expected:

✅ 1. Confirm assetlinks.json is correctly configured and accessible

You mentioned you've already fixed this, but double-check these:

URL: https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json

Must be served over HTTPS.

Must return the correct Content-Type: application/json.

No redirects or errors.

Structure should look like:

[{
  "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
  "target": {
    "namespace": "android_app",
    "package_name": "com.your.package.name",
    "sha256_cert_fingerprints": [
      "AB:CD:EF:..."
    ]
  }
}]

✅ 2. Make sure you're using a Trusted Web Activity (TWA)

A PWA installed from the Play Store via PWA Builder is usually wrapped in a TWA, which should not show the URL bar if everything is set correctly.

If it’s still showing the URL bar, that usually means the TWA fallback mode is being triggered — here's what to check:

🛠️ 3. TWA fallback mode gets triggered when:

The domain is not verified (already fixed via assetlinks).

The app doesn’t meet PWA install criteria (e.g., missing Service Worker or manifest issues).

The manifest file doesn't match the expectations.

There's a mismatch in the host or path (e.g., your TWA points to a different subdomain or path than the one verified in assetlinks).

✅ 4. Check your TWA manifest and intent filters

In your Android project (generated by PWA Builder), ensure your AndroidManifest.xml (or the TWA builder config) includes:

<intent-filter android:autoVerify="true">
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <data android:scheme="https"
          android:host="yourdomain.com"
          android:pathPrefix="/" />
</intent-filter>


android:autoVerify="true" is key for verification.

pathPrefix should match the root of your PWA (or narrow it down if needed).

✅ 5. Your PWA must pass all installability checks

Use Chrome DevTools on desktop or mobile (or Lighthouse audit) to make sure your PWA:

Has a valid manifest.json with:

start_url

display: standalone or fullscreen

Proper icons

Has a working Service Worker that serves the site offline.

Is served via HTTPS.

If it’s not installable by Chrome, the TWA will fall back to showing the URL.

✅ 6. Double-check PWA Builder settings

If you're using PWA Builder (https://www.pwabuilder.com/
):

In the TWA builder options, ensure the correct start URL, package name, and fingerprint were used.

Re-generate the Android project if you changed any of these.

🔁 Summary Fix Flow

✅ Validate your assetlinks.json using the Google API (linked above).

✅ Confirm your site is PWA-installable using DevTools.

✅ Ensure display is set to standalone in manifest.json.

✅ Check AndroidManifest.xml for proper intent-filters with autoVerify.

🔄 If you’ve made changes after publishing, rebuild and re-upload the APK/AAB to the Play Console.
