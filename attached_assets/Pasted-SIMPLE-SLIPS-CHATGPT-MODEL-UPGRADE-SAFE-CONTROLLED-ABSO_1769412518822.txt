SIMPLE SLIPS — CHATGPT MODEL UPGRADE (SAFE & CONTROLLED)
⚠️ ABSOLUTE RULES

DO NOT change prompts yet

DO NOT refactor conversation logic

DO NOT change UI

DO NOT remove existing model usage

DO NOT guess model names

Inspection first, then upgrade

CONTEXT

Simple Slips has an embedded chatbot powered by OpenAI / ChatGPT.

Current state:

Uses an older GPT-4 / GPT-4-Turbo / GPT-4.0 model

We want to upgrade to the latest available OpenAI model

Must preserve:

Prompt behavior

Conversation memory

Cost control

Response format

OBJECTIVE (PHASE 1 — INSPECTION)

Identify exactly:

Which OpenAI SDK is used

Which model is configured

Where the model is defined

How prompts and messages are constructed

No upgrades yet.

REQUIRED OUTPUT (PASTE RAW CODE)
1️⃣ OPENAI CLIENT INITIALIZATION

Paste all backend code where OpenAI is initialized, including:

SDK import

Client creation

API key usage

Any wrappers or helpers

Likely files:

server/openai.ts
server/ai/*
server/chat/*
server/routes.ts

2️⃣ CHAT COMPLETION / RESPONSES CALL

Paste every place where OpenAI is called:

chat.completions.create

responses.create

createChatCompletion

Any abstraction layer

Include:

Model name

Temperature

Max tokens

System prompt

Message structure

3️⃣ MODEL CONFIG LOCATION

Confirm:

Is the model name hardcoded?

Is it read from ENV?

Is it user-selectable?

Is it different per feature?

Paste that code.

4️⃣ CONVERSATION MEMORY HANDLING

Paste code showing:

How messages are stored

How previous messages are sent

Any truncation logic

Any summarization logic

This matters for compatibility with newer models.

5️⃣ STREAMING (IF USED)

If streaming responses:

Paste streaming handler

Paste frontend consumer logic

6️⃣ ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

List names only (no secrets):

OPENAI_API_KEY

MODEL_NAME

Any AI-related flags

NON-GOALS (DO NOT DO)

❌ Do NOT upgrade models yet
❌ Do NOT change prompts
❌ Do NOT convert to agents yet
❌ Do NOT change pricing logic

SUCCESS CONDITION (PHASE 1)

From this output, it must be possible to answer:

What model is currently used

How risky the upgrade is

Whether we should do:

a drop-in replacement

or a compatibility wrapper
