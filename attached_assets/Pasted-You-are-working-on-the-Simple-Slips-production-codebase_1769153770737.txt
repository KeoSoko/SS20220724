You are working on the Simple Slips production codebase.

Context:

Business emails (quotes, invoices) must continue using:

notifications@simpleslips.co.za


Account-related emails (email verification + password reset) must instead use:

hello@simpleslips.co.za


hello@simpleslips.co.za is a verified sender in SendGrid and is an alias of admin@simpleslips.co.za

⚠️ ABSOLUTE RULES

DO NOT refactor EmailService

DO NOT change any non-auth email behaviour

DO NOT rename files, classes, or methods

DO NOT change SendGrid templates

DO NOT touch receipt ingestion or billing emails

Changes must be minimal, additive, and reversible

OBJECTIVE

Ensure that:

Email verification emails

Password reset emails

are sent only from:

hello@simpleslips.co.za


while all other emails remain unchanged.

REQUIRED IMPLEMENTATION (EXACT)
1️⃣ ADD ENV VARIABLE SUPPORT

Introduce a new environment variable:

AUTH_FROM_EMAIL=hello@simpleslips.co.za


Do NOT hardcode this value.

2️⃣ EMAIL VERIFICATION SENDER (MANDATORY)

In sendEmailVerification():

Change the from.email field so that:

It uses process.env.AUTH_FROM_EMAIL if present

Falls back to the existing default sender otherwise

This change must affect only this method.

3️⃣ PASSWORD RESET SENDER (MANDATORY)

In the password reset email method:

Apply the same sender logic as email verification

Use AUTH_FROM_EMAIL as primary sender

Do NOT duplicate code unnecessarily

4️⃣ NON-GOALS (DO NOT DO)

❌ Do NOT change:

Business email senders

notifications@simpleslips.co.za
 usage

Email templates

Verification tokens

Signup logic

SUCCESS CRITERIA

After this change:

Signup verification emails come from hello@simpleslips.co.za

Password reset emails come from hello@simpleslips.co.za

Quotes and invoices still come from notifications@simpleslips.co.za

No other email behaviour is altered

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Show only the minimal code diff

Clearly state which methods were modified

Confirm no unrelated logic was changed

Do not proceed unless all requirements are met.
